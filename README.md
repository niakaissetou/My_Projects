# Wolfram
The goal of this project is to implement Wolfram’s elementary cellular automaton in the terminal.
rule 30, rule 90 and rule 110 are implemented.

options that should be done:
• --rule : the ruleset to use (no default value, mandatory)

• --start : the generation number at which to start the display. The default value is 0.

• --lines : the number of lines to display. When omitted, the program never stops.

• --window : the number of cells to display on each line (line width).

• --move : a translation to apply on the window. If negative, the window is translated to the left. If positive, it’s translated to the right
